# Parking App
In this project we shall be building an android based native application used for 
booking parking slots from various locations. The mobile application will have 3 types 
of users: 
1. Users - Anyone who comes to the app to book a parking slot. 
2. Parking Lot Owner - The person who owns/manages the parking lot. 
3. Admin - The person who manages users and all configuration and settings of 
the system.

Flow of the project
1. The user and the owner will register and login to the app. 
2. At the time of the registration the owner will enter the total number of parking 
slots. 
3. The user will login and book the parking slot and enter the details of the car. 
After booking the parking slot/spaces the user will get a unique id which will be 
verified by the owner at the time of the parking. 
4. The user will reach the parking area with the help of GPS. 
5. The owner interface will have a table which will contain the details of the 
vehicle as well as the user. This table will be updated automatically after 
verification by the user. 
6. At the end the user will pay the amount according to the time slot. After that the 
user exits the parking area, the owner interface will be updated automatically 
and the status of the parking lot will become available. 
7. The admin will have the details of the user, vehicle as well as their arrival and 
exit time stored in the database.
